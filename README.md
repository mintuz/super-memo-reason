# Super Memo Reason

I am currently playing around with ReasonML and wanted an algorithm to practice against.

I decided on implementing super memo v2, a spaced reptition algorithm used for recalling information. (https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2).

Please note this module has not been published to npm as I don't believe it to be production ready.
